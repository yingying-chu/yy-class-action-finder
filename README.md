# Class Action Settlement Tools for Claude Code

Two Claude skills that scan your Gmail for class action settlements, score each email for legitimacy, and track what you've filed and received — so you don't leave money on the table.

Once installed, the skills work **globally** — in any folder, any project, any Claude Code session.

---

## Quick start

### 1. Install Claude Code

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### 2. Connect Gmail

The scanner reads your Gmail via Claude's MCP integration — it never stores or transmits your email data.

1. Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) → **Settings → Integrations**
2. Connect **Gmail** and authorize read access

### 3. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yingying-chu/yy-creatives.git
cd yy-creatives
./install.sh
```

Then open Claude Code anywhere and type:

```
/class-action-scanner
```

## How it works

Most people have unclaimed class action settlements sitting in their inbox (or spam folder). These tools:

1. **Scan** your Gmail across inbox, spam, and promotions using targeted search queries
2. **Score** every email for phishing risk before you act on it (🟢 safe → 🔴 do not click)
3. **Verify** open deadlines and payouts by fetching the actual settlement website
4. **Report** everything in one structured file: what to file now, what to watch, what expired, and what you've already submitted

## `/class-action-scanner`

### Usage

```
/class-action-scanner              # last 12 months (default)
/class-action-scanner 6 months     # last 6 months
/class-action-scanner 2024         # all of 2024
/class-action-scanner 2023 to 2024 # custom range
```

### What the report contains

| Section | What's in it |
|---|---|
| **Active Claims** | Open claim windows with deadlines — sorted soonest first |
| **Watch List** | Lawsuits announced but claim form not yet open |
| **Expired** | Deadlines already passed — for reference |
| **Already Filed** | Cross-referenced from your tracker |
| **Phishing Alerts** | Emails that scored below 40% — do not click these |

### Phishing scoring

Every email gets a confidence score before it reaches you:

| Score | Level | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 85–100% | 🟢 High confidence | Case verified in news/court records, known admin domain |
| 60–84% | 🟡 Likely legitimate | Most signals positive, limited independent verification |
| 40–59% | 🟠 Uncertain | Verify manually before acting |
| < 40% | 🔴 Phishing risk | Do not visit any links — report as phishing |

Green flags: sender is a known administrator (Epiq, Kroll, JND), case appears in news or PACER, no payment requested, court case number present.

Red flags: requests a processing fee, asks for SSN or bank account, case name returns zero search results, random sender domain.

## `/class-action-tracker`

Keeps a running record of what you've filed, what you're watching, and what you've been paid. Data lives in `~/.claude/class-action-tracker.json` on your machine — never committed to this repo.

### Usage

```
/class-action-tracker list
```
Shows all filed claims, watch list items, and payouts received.

```
/class-action-tracker filed LastPass claim ID 3F74V49V9V
```
Marks a claim as filed and saves the claim ID.

```
/class-action-tracker payout "Blue Cross Blue Shield" $47.30
```
Records a payment received.

```
/class-action-tracker watch "Amazon Alexa Privacy"
```
Adds a case to your watch list for when the claim form opens.

The scanner automatically cross-references this tracker and marks already-filed claims with ✅ in the report.

## Privacy

- The scanner uses Gmail's search API (read-only) via Claude's MCP integration
- No email content is stored anywhere by these tools
- The tracker file (`~/.claude/class-action-tracker.json`) is local to your machine and not synced
- Settlement websites are fetched to verify deadlines — only the claim URL is visited, not your personal data
